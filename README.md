# Regulatory-Sandbox-Simulator
The Regulatory Sandbox Simulator is a lightweight, modular prototype of a financial compliance environment. It models the core components of a payment institution — including customer onboarding (KYC), transaction processing, and real-time anti–money laundering (AML) assessment — within a controlled, observable architecture.
